#  What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following a static set of instructions, ML systems improve their performance through experience.

At its core, ML involves building models that can recognize patterns, make predictions, and adapt to new inputs over time. It is used in applications like spam detection, recommendation systems, language translation, self-driving cars, and medical diagnosis.

> "A computer program is said to learn from experience **E** with respect to some task **T** and some performance measure **P**, if its performance on **T** as measured by **P** improves with experience **E**." — *Tom M. Mitchell*

# 📚 Types of Machine Learning

Machine Learning is broadly categorized into four types based on the kind of learning signal or feedback available to a learning system:

## 1. Supervised Learning

* **Definition**: The model is trained on a labeled dataset (input-output pairs).
* **Goal**: Learn a mapping function from inputs to outputs.
* **Examples**: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines
* **Applications**: Spam detection, stock price prediction, house price estimation

## 2. Unsupervised Learning

* **Definition**: The model is given data without explicit instructions on what to do with it.
* **Goal**: Discover hidden patterns or groupings in data.
* **Examples**: K-Means Clustering, PCA, Autoencoders
* **Applications**: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection

## 3. Semi-Supervised Learning

* **Definition**: A mix of labeled and unlabeled data used for training.
* **Goal**: Use the small amount of labeled data to better leverage the unlabeled data.
* **Examples**: Self-training, co-training algorithms
* **Applications**: Image and speech classification where labeling is expensive

## 4. Reinforcement Learning

* **Definition**: An agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.
* **Goal**: Learn a policy that maps states to actions.
* **Examples**: Q-learning, Deep Q Networks (DQNs), Policy Gradients
* **Applications**: Robotics, game playing (like AlphaGo), recommendation engines
